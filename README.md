My name is Sarunas. Currently I am a research associate at the Center for Cold Matter, Imperial College London. There I cool molecules and atoms to temperatures of just a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero, a regime where the quantum properties of individual particles emerge, and study how they interact.

For my research I do a fair bit of numerical simulations to design the experimental procedures and better understand observations. I perform statistical data analysis on a daily basis- mostly via the frequentist approach but recently more and more employing Bayesian methods.
