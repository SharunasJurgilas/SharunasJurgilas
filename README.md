My name is Sarunas. As of the beginning of 2023 I have left my position of research associate at the Center for Cold Matter (Imperial College London) to have more time to look around and prepare for a job in quantitative finance. As a physicist, I used to cool molecules and atoms to temperatures of just a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero (or 1 micro Kelvin), trap and mix them, and study how they interact. It turns out that these very low energy interactions are nutoriously hard to describe theoretically from first principles, thus my job was to perform experimental measurements which would guide the theory. My research was extermely hands-on: I designed and built experiments, performed hundreds of tests and callibrations, figured out good experimental procedures, delved deep into statistical analysis of the data to really understand what is going on.

I have experience in languages such as Matlab, Mathematica, C# but for the last several years I have predominantly been using Python.
