My name is Sarunas. Currently I am a research associate at the Center for Cold Matter, Imperial College London. There I cool molecules and atoms to temperatures of just a
few millionths of a degree above absolute zero, a regime where the quantum properties of individual particles become very important, and study how they interact.

For my research I do a fair bit of numerical simulations to better understand experimental observations and perform statistical data analysis on a daily basis.
