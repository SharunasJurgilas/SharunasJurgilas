My name is Sarunas. As of the beginning of 2023 I have left by position as research associate at the Center for Cold Matter (Imperial College London) to have more time to look around for a job in quantitative finance. There I used to cool molecules and atoms to temperatures of just a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero, a regime where the quantum properties of individual particles emerge, and study how they interact. My research was extermely hands-on: I designed and built experiments, performed hundreds of tests and callibrations, figured out good experimental procedures, delved deep into statistical analysis of the data to really understand what is going on.

I have experience in languages such as Matlab, Mathematica, C# but for the last several years I have predominantly been using Python.
