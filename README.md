My name is Sarunas. Currently I work as a research associate at the Center for Cold Matter, Imperial College London. There I cool molecules and atoms to temperatures of just a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero, a regime where the quantum properties of individual particles emerge, and study how they interact.

As part of my research I do numerical simulations to design the experimental procedures and better understand observations. I perform statistical data analysis on a daily basis- mostly via the frequentist approach and recetly by employing Bayesian methods.

Here you will find some of the projects related to my research. As I am currently looking to make a switch to analytical work in an industry setting (DS or ML), I will also be pushing some of the projects I went and will go through to gain experience in the field.
